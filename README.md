# Github Profile Searcher

First project created using Ionic. It is a simple searcher of Github profiles that display info about the profile and the public repos. It has been created following the steps of the [Ionic 2 - Developing A Real-World Mobile App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETWE95UgPtE) video tutorial created by [Sebastian Eschweiler](https://github.com/seeschweiler).
